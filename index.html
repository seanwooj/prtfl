          <p>Here's where people usually define the kind of work that they do in pithy fashion, big font, above a pretty picture ("I love to develop beautiful applications", "I love to write clean, well documented code", etc...).</p>

          <p>I used to do the same until I realized that I was constantly pidgeonholing myself into particular roles, which usually led to disappointing outcomes (for me). I've worked as a web developer, visual and UX designer, and a print designer. I've worked on my own products and started my own small businesses. I've made mistakes along the way; learned a lot in doing so.</p>

          <p>The lack of clarity above is intentional; here is where I might interject a little and hone in on what I actually do.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>I like problem solving. Throughout my career that has involved a number of different tools and roles. I can play an engineer or a designer as needed. I can talk business strategy and look at the big picture. I like to work in the early stages of startups. I like to move quickly, and I really, __really__ dislike when process trumps results.</p>

          <p>I will make no claims at being the best at any of these things. But usually, I'm pretty good.</p>

          <p>If you need someone who can take on a variety of roles, and switch contexts quickly between detailed views of a project and the big, global view, we should probably talk.</p>
