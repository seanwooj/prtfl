          <h3 class="quote-text">Show me a specialist, and I’ll show you a man who’s so scared he’s dug a hole for himself to hide in.</h3>

        <p>Here's where people usually define the kind of work that they do in pithy fashion, big font, above a pretty picture ("I love to develop beautiful applications", "I love to write clean, well documented code", etc...).</p>

        <p>I used to do the same until I realized that I was constantly pidgeonholing myself into particular roles, which usually led to disappointing outcomes (for me). I've worked as a web developer, visual and UX designer, and a print designer. I've worked on my own products and started my own small businesses. I've made mistakes along the way; learned a lot in doing so.</p>

        <p>The lack of clarity above is intentional; here is where I might interject a little and hone in on what I actually do.</p>

        <p>I like problem solving. Throughout my career that has involved a number of different tools and roles. I can play an engineer or a designer as needed. I can talk business strategy and look at the big picture. I like to work in the early stages of startups. I like to move quickly, and I really, __really__ dislike when process trumps results.</p>

        <p>I will make no claims at being the best at any of these things. But usually, I'm pretty good.</p>

        <p>If you need someone who can take on a variety of roles, and switch contexts quickly between detailed views of a project and the big, global view, we should probably talk.</p>

          2. About
        </h2>
        <p>I got my undergraduate degree from the University of Southern California, where I studied Psychology. During school, I worked on a variety of design projects, and tried to start a non-profit and a startup at the same time. I think you might guess where both of those projects went.</p>

        <p>In 2012, I signed up for a program called <a href="#">App Academy</a>, where one could learn how to become a web developer. Seeing nothing better to do, I applied, got accepted, and took my LA life to the Bay Area, where I currently live still.</p>

        <p>I'm an easy person to work and get along with.</p>

        <img src="img/inconsolata.png" class="full-width">
        <p>This portfolio was "typeset" in Times New Roman for header and link elements. The body text is Inconsolata (in 14pt), a monospace font, frequently used in code editors.</p>

        <p>The code for the site was written in Sublime Text 2, in plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The jQuery library is used for some interactions and resizing to screens.</p>

        <p>The hosting is graciously provided by Github pages.</p>

        <p>I don't care if this site works in IE8, 9, or 10. I care a little if it doesn't work in 11.</p>
